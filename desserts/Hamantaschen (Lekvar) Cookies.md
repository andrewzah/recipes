Notes

- Original recipe suggests grated orange peel, but best results were achieved using clementine peel. Suggested method to obtain zested clementine peel is to use a sharp knife to remove the pith from the peel, then mince finely with knife.
- This is similar to Grandma Daniels’s nutjammer squares, but this recipe actually works.

Ingredients
• 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
• 1/2 cups sugar
• 1 tbsp baking powder
• 1 tsp zested clementine peel
• 1/2 tsp salt
• 1 cup butter, softened
• 2 eggs, beaten
• 2 tbsp milk
• 1 can Solo Prune Plum or Apricot filling
• 1 egg yolk beaten with 1 tbsp milk (for brushing)

Instructions

Stir flour, sugar, baking powder, clementine peel, and salt in large bowl. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add eggs and milk and mix until dough binds together. Knead dough for five to eight strokes or until smooth. Divide dough in half and wrap each piece separately in saran wrap; refrigerated one hour.

 Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place parchment paper on baking sheets and set aside. Roll out one piece of dough on lightly floured surface to 1/4 in thickness. Cut dough with floured three inch round plain cookie cutter. Spoon one teaspoon filling onto center of each circle. Fold the circle over onto itself, and compress edges to seal. Place on prepared baking sheets and brush with beaten egg yolk mixture, then sprinkle lightly with sugar. Bake twenty to twenty five minutes or until golden brown.
