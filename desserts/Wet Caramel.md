# Ingredients

* 1 cup granulated sugar
* $\frac 14$ cup water
* lemon juice
* $\frac 14$ cup heavy cream

# Instructions

1. Prepare heavy cream and set it near at hand.
2. Prepare a bowl of cold water and set aside.
3. Combine sugar and water into a clean steel saucepand. Add a few drops of lemon juice.
4. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly.
5. When the sugar begins to carmalize, dump in the heavy cream, stir, and then dip the bottom of the pan in the bowl of cold water to stop cooking. 
	* Careful, the mixture will expand and bubble quite a bit when adding the heavy cream.

Vary the amount of heavy cream to adjust the consistancy of the caramel. Less cream will result in a harder, more brittle caramel, while more will result in a softer, more sauce-like caramel.
