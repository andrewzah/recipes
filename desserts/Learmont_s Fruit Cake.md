Notes

- This is the fruit cake my mom (Sandra) always made, and originated from the Sea Island Seasons cookbook, which was given to my parents as a wedding gift in 1986.

Ingredients

- 1/4 lb candied orange peel, finely chopped
- 1/4 lb candied lemon peel, finely chopped
- 1 lb citron, finely chopped
- 1 lb candied red cherries
- 1 lb candied green cherries
- 3/4 lb candied red pineapple
- 3/4 lb candied green pineapple
- 1 lb rasins (white, black, or mixed)
- 1 lb self rising flour, divided (1/4 goes with the fruit to prevent sticking)
- 1 lb whole pecans
- 1 lb butter
- 1 lb sugar
- 12 eggs, separated
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 4 oz jelly (any flavor)
- 2 oz bourbon
- 1 tsp lemon extract
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 tsp mace
- Brandy or rum for painting

Notes

- Don’t put the water too high in the pans.
- Yields 4 loaf pans.
- Different colors of candied fruit can be substituted based on availability.
- For a gluten free variant, substitute Gluten free bisquick for flour in the same proportions.
- Can be stored frozen approximately six months.

Instructions

1. Cut the fruit with [1/4th]() of the flour.
2. Mix fruits and nuts together thoroughly.
3. Cream butter and sugar (i.e. mix until creamy).
4. Add egg yolks one at a time to butter/sugar mixture, mixing well.
5. Add flour and baking powder, jelly, whiskey, and flavorings.
6. Fold in stiffly beaten egg whites.

7. Pour batter over fruit and carefully fold batter into fruit until well mixed.

8. Grease and flour the 4 loaf pans and carefully pour the batter into them.
9. Put pans of hot water large enough to hold cake pans into oven.
10. Cover loosely with foil and bake at 300° for 2-3 hours or until firm.

11. Remove foil and broil or bake until browned (this should not take very long, as the cake is cooked at this point).

12. Place on cooling racks until fully cooled.

13. Paint liberally with dark rum. Wrap with cheese cloth, then parchment paper, then foil. Allow to age for one week and repeat 2-4 times. Brandy or light rum can be substituted for dark rum in a pinch.
