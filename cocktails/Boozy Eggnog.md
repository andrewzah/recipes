# Boozy Eggnog

## Ingredients

* 1 quart heavy whipping cream
* 1 quart whole milk
* ¾ cup sugar
* 12 medium eggs (or 10 large, or 8 extra large)
* 2 cups brandy (e.g. E&J VSOP)
* 1 cup rye whiskey (e.g. Redemption Rye)
* 1 cup dark rum (e.g. Meyer's Original)
* ½ cup sherry (e.g. Dry Sack sherry)
* 1 tsp nutmeg
* 2 tbsp vanilla extract
* ½ tsp cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Separate the eggs being careful to remove the connective tissue from the yolks, then beat the yolks until they are a smooth pale yellow.
2. Add the sugar and any spices while beating on low.
3. Add the cream and milk while continuing to beat.
4. Finally add the liquor and beat until smooth. 
5. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites to stiff peak, then fold them into the yolk and cream mixture until there are no streaks.
6. Serve the eggnog, or allow it to age.

## Remarks

* If aging the eggnog for less than 2 weeks, the nutmeg flavor may be overwhelming, and you may wish to reduce the nutmeg to ½ tsp.
* The cinnamon and vanilla are based on JPC's family recipe.
