Last time I made this (2021-12-28), I did it with $\frac14$ tsp Absinthe, Redemption Rye and Courvoisier VSOP. It was good but not quite as good as the original I remember from the bar. I would cut back the Absinthe a bit and try to "rinse" the sides of the glass with it instead of just stirring it in. May be worth experimenting with some different cognacs as well.
