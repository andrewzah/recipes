# Turkey Cobb

This is based on a Cobb salad that I bought premade at Lowes Foods several times, but I substituted bacon for turkey and added the green pepper pieces

## Ingredients
- Spring Mix
- Deli Turkey
- Blue Cheese
	- Feta works as a viable alternative
- Kalmanta Olives
- Hard Boiled Egg, sliced
- Cherry Tomatoes
- Green Pepper
- Ranch Dressing, but could be substituted for other ones
