	- Note that the sauce recipe is not doubled, which is required to make the baked ziti properly
## Ingredients
### Sauce
(Ingredients are doubled here)
- 2x 28oz Can of pureed tomatoes
- 8 cloves of Garlic (Thinly Sliced)
- A large handful of basil (with stems)
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 1 cup Parmesan Cheese
- Salt
### Ziti
- 1 LB of Ziti or Rigatoni
- A double batch of Sauce (see below)
- 1/2 Lb Fresh Mozzarella, diced
- 1/2 Lb Dried, Low Moisture Mozzarella, diced
- 1 Lbs Whole Milk Ricotta
- Parmegiano Reggiano
- Salt
- Olive oil
## Instructions
You'll want to make the sauce while cooking the noodles
### Sauce
- prepare basil, grate parmesan cheese
1. In a large skillet, enough olive oil to coat the bottom of the pan on a low heat
2. Add garlic and basil to the pan (we are adding this while the oil is still cold)
3. Slowly steep these ingredients together. (we are looking for the oil to take in a lot of garlic and basil flavor.)
4. Remove the basil once it has wilted and starts to brown. (3-4 mins, optionally you can leave it in as well)
5. Add the tomato puree
6. Bring the heat to medium-high and continue to stir. The idea is to make the oil and the tomatoes and homogenous, emulsified sauce. So it will look a little broken now, but over the cooking process, it should come together.
7. Add a generous pinch of salt and continue to stir. We are cooking this hard and fast - so we will start to see a rapid bubble popping starting to occur on the surface of our sauce. That’s okay. That’s what we’re looking for. Just make sure you don’t burn the sauce once the water starts to cook out of the tomatoes.
8. Once the sauce has come together add ⅓ cup of parmesan cheese (or more - there is no such thing as too much parmesan cheese) to your sauce. Stir to combine. Lower the heat on the stove and bring your sauce to a slow simmer.
9. When you cook any pasta for this, cook it in salty boiling water, but cook it 2 minutes less than the package instructs. In the final two minutes, the pasta should finish cooking in the sauce to help thicken the sauce and help the pasta absorb the sauce. Then finish with some more cheese and basil.
### Ziti
1. Prepare a double batch of weekday sauce, but cook it to a slightly looser consistency than you would for pasta. Baked ziti cooks halfway in water, and then halfway in a baking dish so we need to add more liquid to the baking dish, making the paster saucier than you might think, to account for the pasta absorbing liquid while baking. Set aside and Bring a pot of salty water to a boil.
2. Add the pasta and cook it no more than halfway through, if anything, cook it less than halfway through to achieve a more al dente final product.
3. Once the pasta is half cooked, drain the pasta and dry it well.
4. Preheat the oven to 400-425 degrees, depending on your oven.
5. In a large bowl, add some sauce, then the pasta and mix. Ladle in additional pasta sauce, a little more than you might normally, then add the ricotta and mix it all together. Sprinkle in some parm and then a handful of the diced cheese, reserving most of it for layering in the baking dish.
6. In a baking dish, add a base layer of sauce to the dish, then half the pasta, then a layer of the diced cheese and a little parm. Then add the rest of the pasta. Create an uneven top layer so that some pieces of pasta stick out. This will create a really texturally interesting top crust with some crispy pasta bits which are the best part. Then dot the top layer with the diced cheese and parm and then drizzle with olive oil.
7. Place the baking dish on a sheet tray to catch any bubbling over. Bake at 400-425 for 25-30 minutes, or until the pasta is bubbling everywhere and the top layer of cheese is starting to brown and caramelize. If you need to achieve more color and worry that cooking longer will overcook the pasta then use the broiler to quickly char up the top layer. Once the bake looks right and dark and delicious, pull it from the oven.
8. Rest before serving.
