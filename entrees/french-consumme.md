The recipe I make for Stock is a french Consummé, a consummé is a second stock you make with the liquid from your first with the specific goal to clarify the liquid as well as add more flavor. This means that the recipe I have for the first stock is “dirty” as in no steps are taken to make sure you have a glassy finish. It will make a cloudy muddy stock that will still be really good and we’re not cooking for french royalty so our heads aren’t on the line. Starting with Day 1 and the Brown stock

  

# Brown Stock:

(White Stock except everything is browned in the oven, and simmered for a little less time with more ingredients) *This part can be done in a pressure cooker, I just don’t have the times or specifications for this.

Bones:

- Veal Bones 8lbs (I use what ever beef bones I have, they don’t need to be pristine a little fat and meat wont hurt.)

  

Mirepoix (Veggies) 1lbs

- Onions 8oz (Roughly Chopped, with skins for color)

- Carrots 4oz (Roughly Chopped)

- Celery 4oz (Roughly Chopped)

  

- Tomato Paste 6oz

  

Standard Sachet/Cheesecloth of Spices

- Parsley w/ Stems 3 or 4

- Thyme Leaf ½ teas

- Bay Leaf

- Peppercorns, assorted, cracked ½ teas

  

  

1) Rinse bones clean and dry well

2) Coat bones in olive oil or preferred oil, brown in 375deg oven as needed

3) Add bones to stock pot w/ 6qts of cold water. Bring stock to boil over low heat.

4) Keep stock at simmer for 6 hours, simmer as necessary

5) Wait 4-5 hours

5) Wash and Chop Mirepoix, dry well. Add olive oil and roast in the oven at 375deg as needed

6) at the 5 hour mark, add Mirepoix to stock, de-glaze roasting pan into stock, add Tomato Paste and Spice Sachet.

7) Simmer for one more hour, Strain and you’re done.

  

  

In a consummé you start with your previously prepared cold stock, and mix together a mound of horror - ground beef, diced vegetables, diced tomatoes, and a whole lot of egg whites. You combine your stock and ‘horror mixture’ in a cold stock pot and stir, gently adding heating gradually until the egg whites begin to form together, rising to the surface. This stirring can take a long time but every second counts to pushing more flavor out of these ingredients and into your stock. As the egg whites set, they will form a dense foam and begin to rise up out of the stock, we call this the ‘raft’ because as the foam rises it is carrying with it the impurities that make our stock cloudy and muddy. Once a solid raft has formed carefully scoop making yourself a little opening to the water below (making sure not to reintroduce impurities into the stock below “breaking the raft”) and ladle out your clarified stock into a separate container. The result should be glossy and translucent stock with the flavor of two batches of meat, spices, and vegetables.

  

# Classic French Consummé

Now hopefully we have at least 5qts of Brown stock for our consummé

  

Meats:

- Ground Shank 3lbs (I don’t always use shank, but this flavor will permeate the stock so getting some good ground beef is best)

  

Veggies:

Mirepoix 1lbs – same as previous, except make sure to dice your onions carrots and celery this time, you want the mirepoix to rise with the raft (so nothing too heavy, tiny pieces)

-Tomatoes, diced 12oz

optional – Onion Brûlé 1 onion, (Basically a caramelized halved onion added to the pot, I don’t love what this does to the “raft” process but its in there for color, I’m here or there on it.)

  

- Egg Whites, beaten til foamy. 10x eggs

  

- Cold Beef Stock, 5qts

  

Spices all in the cheese cloth:

-Standard Sachet from before same shit different day

- Whole Cloves 1 each

- Allspice Berries 1 each

  

- Kosher Salt and White Pepper to taste at the end.

  

  

1) Mix all ingredients (except spices), with cold stock, in a stock pot and mix well

2) Slowly bring to simmer, stirring consistently stopping when the raft forms.

3) Add sachet and simmer for another 45 minutes

4) carefully ladle clarified stock out from under the raft, strain.

5) Adjust seasoning and fucking ENJOY.

  

  

Bonus Round:  
  

The Brown stock I specified for Day 1 can be modified pretty quickly into a ton of different stocks  
  
White Stock:

*Skip the browning part for all the ingredients

*No Tomato Paste

* Simmer for longer, 8hrs

  

Chicken Stock:  
*Same as White Stock

*Use Chicken Bones

*Simmer for 4-5hrs

  

Fish Stock:

*Same as Chicken Stock

*Use 11lbs fish bones

*Combine veggies, bones, spices all at once.

*Only simmer for about 30-40 min.
