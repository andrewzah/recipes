4. Prepare the tomato puree (i.e. open the can) and set aside.

7. Stir the cream and sugar into the sauce. Add the chicken back to the pan and cook for an additional 8-10 minutes until chicken is cooked through. Add the water if the sauce becomes too thick.
8. Garnish with cilantro and serve over basmithi rice.
