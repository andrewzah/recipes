# Instructions

1. Pre-heat oven to $470^\circ$.

3. Add the butter to the floor and toss with spoons. Place in the freezer for another 15 minutes.
4. Stir the lemon juice into the milk.
4. Pour the milk mixture into the flour/butter mixture and stir until just incorporated.
5. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface.
6. Using a floured rolling pin, roll the dough into into an $8\times10$ rectangle. Fold over one side and roll out again. Repeate two more times.
