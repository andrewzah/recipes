# Three-meat Stromboli
Originally intended as a appetizer, this meal is really a crowd-pleaser and a favorite of the FNC crowd. Goes great with some marinara sauce and a veggie tray.

Makes 3 stromboli rolls.

Recipe originally from allrecipes.com (printed in 2011, but it appears to have been removed), but adapted from Mom's collection

## Ingredients
_amounts listed do not need to be exact_
- 3 loaves frozen bread dough
- 6oz thinly sliced salami
- 6oz thinly sliced deli ham
- 6oz thinly sliced pepperoni
- 6oz thinly sliced provalone cheese
- 2 + 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1/2 cup romano or parmesean cheese
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder
- 1 tablespoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried parsley flakes
- 1 teaspoon pepper
- 1 egg yolk, beaten

## Directions

1. Let dough rise until doubled (follow dough package instructions). If frozen, let dough thaw first. This may take a few hours.
	a. If in a hurry, dough can quickly be thawed by placing the still-sealed package in warm water
2. Preheat oven to 375°F
3. Stretch out dough into a large greased baking sheet
4. Divide the meats, cheeses, and spices into 3 separate groups
5. Make the strombolis, leaving about a 1-in margin around the edges
	a. Begin by covering the dough surface with mozzarella and parmesean cheese
	b. Add the spices to the cheese
	c. Layer the provalone cheese on top of the grated cheeses
	d. Layer the meats on top of the cheese
6. Roll up dough jelly-roll style beginning with the long side
	a. Seal seams and ends
	b. Place seam side down on the greased baking sheet
	c. brush with egg yolk
	d. (optional) sprinkle additional spices and cheese on top of roll
7. Bake at 375°F for 25-30mins or until golden brown
	a. Let stand for 5 mins before serving
	b. serve warm
	c. refrigerate leftovers (it's good cold the next day)
	d. For longer storage periods, can also be frozen


## Notes
- Frozen pizza dough balls can be substituted for frozen bread dough (get 3 balls, one for each)
	- This also means that letting the dough rise is not a problem
- All cheese types can be substituted for 2x 2cup bags of shredded italian cheese blend
	- Generally contains:
		- mozarella
		- parmesean
		- provalone
- The Boar's Head stick of pepperoni usually found at Publix near the deli works great for this
	- Maybe get 2x sticks, and use at least half of the 2nd one?
- Olive oil can compliment the egg yolk mixture for topping the stromboli rolls
- Amount of meats used does not need to be exact. I tend to just use the whole pack and it always comes out just fine
- Italian seasoning blend also works great in place of separate spices
	- it has additional spices not called for in the regular recipe
- Might be good to try adding more cheese
	- 3x 2cup bags of italian cheese blend
- Basil Leaves are good to roll into the stromboli
	- Doesn't seem to add _that_ much, but it certainly doesn't hurt it
