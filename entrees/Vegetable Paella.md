* 1 medium yellow onion, chopped fine
* 1 teaspoons fine sea salt, divided
* 6 garlic cloves, pressed or minced
* 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
* 1 can (15 ounces) diced tomatoes (preferably the fire-roasted variety), drained
* 2 cups short-grain brown rice
* 1 can (15 ounces) chickpeas, rinsed and drained, or 1 ½ cups cooked chickpeas
* 3 cups vegetable broth
* ⅓ cup dry white wine or vegetable broth

Vegtables
* 1tbsp olive oil
* $\frac12$ tsp salt
* 1 can (14 ounces) quartered artichokes or 1 jar (12 ounces) marinated artichoke, drained
* 2 red bell peppers, stemmed, seeded and sliced into long, ½”-wide strips
* ½ cup Kalamata olives, pitted and halved

* 2 tablespoons lemon juice


# Instructions


1. Preheat the oven to 350$^\circ$F
2. Heat 2 tbsp oil in a stock pot until shimmering. Add onion and a pinch of salt. Cook until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes.
3. Stir in garlic and paprika, cooling until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tomatoes and cook until they begin to disintigrate.
4. Stir in rice and mix well, then add chickpeas, broth, wine, and 1tsp salt.
5. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Place a dish towel over the pot, then the lid on top. Allow to simmer slowly without stirring until liquid is fully absorbed, about 45 minutes.
6. Toss together artichoke, peppers, olives, 1tsp olive oil, $\frac12$tsp salt, and about 10 twists of freshly ground black pepper.
7. Spread vegtables evenly over a pan, then bake for 40 to 45 minutes or until peppers are tender.
8. After removing the pan, add $\frac14$ cup parsley and lemon juice, tossing to combine.
9. Serve the rice topped with the tossed vegtables. Garnish with lemon and parsley to taste.
