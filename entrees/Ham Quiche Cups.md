Ingredients

- 5 eggs
- 1 cup milk
- 12 slices Swiss cheese shredded
- 1/4 cup green onion, chopped
- 1/2 tsp dried thyme
- 1/4 tsp kosher salt
- 1/8 tsp black pepper
- 18 slices ham

Notes

- If the tops brown too quickly, place aluminum foil over the top of each cup and continue to cook.
- Yields 3 cereal bowl sized quiches.
- Use cereal bowls instead of quiche cups.

Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350°.
2. In a medium mixing bowl whisk the eggs.

3. Add milk, cheese, green onion, thyme, salt and pepper to the eggs and stir well.

4. Cut each slice of ham in half and set to the side.
5. Spray individual, oven safe quiche cups with cooking spray.
6. Place two half slices of ham into each individual quiche cup.

7. For each individual quiche cup, spoon about three tablespoons of egg mixture so it is 3/4ths full.

8. Use a fork to distribute the cheese.

9. Bake for 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

10. Remove from oven and serve warm.
