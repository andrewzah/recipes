If your guest are big eaters, I would plan for 2 burgers each. If you’re having other meats at the meal with sides, just cook 1 or 2 extra. 

Ingredients:
-Ground turkey or chicken extra lean or lean  ground turkey is a healthier and has less calories I don’t always have a choice, I buy which ever one they have. (You can buy the patties already made In the meat department. I do that because it saves time and I have to do is cook it because it saves time or you could buy packages of ground Turkey or chicken and make your own. 1 pound equals four medium patties.)

- veg oil (for cooking Burgers in fryer on the stove.  3 to 4 tablespoons in a non-stick fryer for 4 patties
-Oyster sauce Bottle
-Mayonnaise min 3/4-1 cup
-Cilantro - half batch chopped
-English cucumber sliced 
-Red onion sliced
-Tomato Sliced
-Pepperidge Farms Buns  - onion or regular buns.  Or regular hamburger buns will also work. I just think the others taste better. 

-Lots of paper towels (napkins fall apart to easy) because you know they’re super messy. But very worth it.

Remember the burgers wind up being quite tall and you kind of have to squish and hold the Burger together to eat it.

Cooking:
Make or have the patties ready. Put oil in nonstick pan, put patties in pan when the oil is hot. I usually turn it up on high to get it going and then turn it down to medium as I go.  You want to make sure the patty it’s cooked all the way through. 

Cook until the patties are done, flipping them over after they cooking on one side.  NOTE the ground turkey or chicken will fall apart easier so be gentle when flipping the patties over and make sure that they are starting to cook on the one side before turning. Once they start to cook a little bit on both sides, you can flatten them with the spatula to thin them out a little and see that they cook through.  Make sure you wash your hands thoroughly before touching any other foods, pots, pans and knives.

Slice the veggies and have ready to assemble your burger when ready.

We usually like to toast our buns, (You do not have to but they will break apart a little quicker while eating) you can open buns up and put them on a boiler pan, but be very careful as they will burn quickly becausebecause you forget they’re in oven. If the boilers already and I actually put them in stand and watch them and flip them over, probably less than a minute. You can just put them in the toaster oven and make a stack to be ready. 

After chopping your cilantro, combine with mayo and mix it up. I use half batch Cilantro. Mix into 3/4 to 1 cup mayo.  depending on the size of the cilantro batch you may have to eyeball it.  Some people only like a little on their burger. 

I tend to like a lot so I make a bigger batch.  (I will also eat mix on a sandwich.). As long as you have the extra cilantro and mayo, you can make a 3/4 cup batch and if it looks like you’re running low it’s very quick to make a little more. That way you don’t have a bunch left over.

If someone is never had a burger, I usually assemble it for them. I just asking if they don’t like tomatoes, onions or  cucumbers.  You’ve got younger people, I’m sure y’all can sit down and you can show them one.

What makes the burger is the combination of the ingredients along with the oyster sauce and mayo mix. I found it still taste good if it’s missing one of the vegetables, but the oyster sauce and mayo and cilantro sauce is what makes it, along with the turkey or chicken patty.

Of course you can’t tell people what they can and can’t eat  so far MJ whatever they want and you tell him the process of layering.  LOL

Have fun and enjoy.

I’m typing this in a rush, so if you have any questions or something doesn’t make sense let me know. Love you.
