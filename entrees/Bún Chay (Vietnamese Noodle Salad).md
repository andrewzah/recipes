# Ingredients

For the Dressing

* $\frac{1}{4}$ cup rice vinegar
* 3 tablespoons lime juice
* 3 tablespoons coconut, date, or brown sugar
* 2 tablespoons mushroom soy sauce (or low-sodium soy sauce)
* 2 tablespoons freshly grated lemongrass (white part only)
* 1 clove garlic, grated
* 1 to 2 bird's eye chilies, sliced (optional)
* 2 to 3 dashes Maggi seasoning
* 1 tablespoon water

For the Bún Chay

* 8 ounces thin rice noodles (vermicelli-style)
* 2 carrots, julienned
* 1 large bell pepper (orange, yellow, or red), thinly sliced
* 1 cup English cucumber half moons
* 1 cup cilantro stems and leaves (remove tough stem ends if desired)
* 1 cup Thai basil leaves
* 1 cup mint leaves
* 1 cup chopped peanuts
* Lime wedges for serving (optional)

For the Caramelized Tofu

* 1 tablespoon peanut oil
* 14 ounces firm tofu, sliced into bite-sized rectangles
* 2 teaspoons mushroom soy sauce, or low sodium soy-sauce
* 1 tablespoon sesame oil
* 1 tablespoon coconut or date sugar

# Instructions

1. Set a large pot of water on the stove to boil. Whisk the dressing ingredients together in a small bowl. Set aside to infuse.
    
2. Cook the noodles according to package directions; rinse with cold water, drain well, then divide into four serving bowls.
    
3. Heat one tablespoon of peanut oil in a large skillet set over medium heat. Add the tofu pieces and fry until golden brown, about 5 to 7 minutes on both sides. While the tofu is frying, stir the mushroom soy sauce, sesame oil, and sugar together in a small bowl until the sugar has dissolved.
    
4. Once the tofu is browned, pour this mixture into the pan. Allow the sauce to cook in the pan for 1 to 2 minutes, until it begins to thicken. Flip the tofu to ensure the sauce coats and sticks to each side. Cook for another minute or so, until the tofu is caramelized and sticky. Transfer the tofu to the noodle bowls.
    
5. Top the noodle bowls with julienned carrot, sliced bell pepper, cucumber half moons, herbs, and peanuts. Pour a quarter of the prepared dressing over each bowl. Serve at once.
