# Ingredients

* 6 medium waxy potatoes, peeled and cut into bite-sized pieces
* $1 \frac12$ teaspoons kosher salt, divided
* 1 teaspoon turmeric
* 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 2 teaspoons black mustard seed
* 1 teaspoon curry powder
* 1 teaspoon garam masala

# Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Place the potatoes in a large pot along with 1 teaspoon of the salt, turmeric, and enough water to cover by one inch. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Strain the potatoes from the water and transfer to a large bowl.
2. Add the oil, mustard seed, curry powder, garam masala, and remaining salt to the bowl and toss with potatoes. Transfer the potatoes to a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and roast in the pre-heated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, flipping the potatoes once half-way through. Remove from oven once the potatoes are fork-tender. Serve hot.
